  "//": "BUILD NOTES: Source files are JSX (src/). The build script (build.js) uses Babel to pre-compile them into plain CommonJS JS (dist/) so consumers never need to transpile this package themselves. @babel/preset-react is configured with { runtime: 'automatic' } which uses the new JSX transform — it imports from react/jsx-runtime automatically instead of requiring React to be in scope (the classic runtime would inject React.createElement() calls that fail if React is not globally imported). @babel/preset-env compiles ESM imports/exports and modern syntax to CommonJS-compatible output. The 'exports' field below takes strict precedence over 'main' in webpack 5 and Node 12+. Without it, npm link + webpack symlink resolution can bypass 'main' and resolve to raw JSX source files the consumer's bundler cannot parse.",
